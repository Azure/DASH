# SONiC-DASH High Level Design

This document describes the **SONiC Disaggregated API for SONiC Hosts** (SONiC-DASH) high level design and architecture. SONiC-DASH (DASH for short) is an open source project that will deliver enterprise network performance to critical cloud applications. The ultimate goal is that DASH will have the same success as [SONiC](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC) for switches and also be widely adopted as a major **Open NOS for Programmable Hardware Technologies**, including [SmartNICs](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/10/29/what-is-a-smartnic/), to supercharge a variety of cloud and enterprise applications.

## Overview 

DASH extends SONiC APIs and a comprehensive set of object models that initially describe Microsoft Azureâ€™s networking services for the cloud. The project enlists cloud and enterprise providers to further extend DASH to meet their specific needs.

See the project [Scenario Milestone and Scoping](SDN-Features-Packet-Transforms.md#scenario-milestone-and-scoping). 

### Requirements

The overall requirement is to **optimize network SMART Programmable Technologies performance**, and **leverage commodity hardware technology** to achieve **10x or even 100x stateful connection performance**.
- With the help of network hardware vendors, create an open forum that capitalizes on the use of **programmable networking hardware** including SmartNICs, SmartToRs, SmartAppliances. 
- Optimize **stateful L4** performance and connection scale by 10x or even 100x when compared to implementations that make extensive use of software. As host networking in the cloud is performed at L4 the resulting performance improvements should be truly significant.
- Microsoft Azure will integrate and deploy DASH solutions to ensure that scale, monitoring, reliability, availability and constant innovation are proven and hardened. It should be noted that innovations for **in-service software upgrades** (ISSU) and **high availability** (HA) are key tenets of the DASH charter.

## Architecture

SONiC is structured into various containers that communicate through multiple logical databases via a shared Redis instance. DASH will make use of the SONiC infrastructure as shown in the figure below. The following is a high level view of DASH architecture. 


**DASH architecture**

### SDN controller

The SDN controller is **primarily responsible for controlling the DASH overlay services**, while the traditional SONiC stack is used to manage the underlay (L3 routing) and hardware platform. 

The SDN controller controls the overlay built on top of the physical layer of the infrastructure.  From the point of view of the SDN control plane, when a customer creates an operation, for example a VNET creation, from the cloud portal, the controller allocates the resources, placement management, capacity, etc. via the  **NorthBound interface APIs**.

#### SDN and DPU High-Availability (HA)

For **High Availability** (HA), the SDN controller selects the pair of cards and configures them identically.  The only requirement on the card from the HA perspective is for the cards to setup a channel between themselves for flow synchronization.  The synchronization mechanism is left for vendors to define and implement. For more information, see [High Availability and Scale]() document.   


### DASH container
 
The SDN controller communicates with a DASH device through a **[gNMI](https://github.com/Azure/DASH/wiki/Glossary#gnmi) endpoint** served by a new DASH SDN agent **running inside a new SONiC DASH container**.  

In particular 
- The **SONiC orchagent** will be enhanced to translate these objects into **SAI_DB objects**, including the new **DASH-specific SAI objects**. 
- An **enhanced syncd** will then configure the dataplane using the **vendor-specific SAI library**.

A **gNMI schema** will manage the following DASH services: 
- Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) 
- Routing and mappings
- Encapsulations 
- Other  

#### Multiple DPUs device

In the case of a multiple DPUs device the following applies:

- Each DPU provides a gNMI endpoint for SDN controller through a unique IP address. 
- An appliance or smart switch containing multiple DPUs therefore contains multiple gNMI endpoints for SDN controller, and the controller treats each DPU as a separate entity. 
- To conserve IPv4 addresses, such an appliance or switch _might_ contain a proxy (NAT) function to map a single IP address:port combination into multiple DPU endpoints with unique IPv4 addresses.  
- No complex logic will run on the switches (switches do not have a top-level view of other/neighboring switches in the infrastructure). 


### Switch State Service (SWSS)


### Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) DASH

 The Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) is a common API that is supported by many switch ASIC vendors. SONiC uses SAI to program the ASIC. This enabled SONiC to work across multiple ASIC platforms naturally. DASH uses an **enhanced syncd** to configure the dataplane using the vendor-specific SAI library.

## High-Level Design

**DASH high level design**

The system architecture for SONiC-DASH relies upon the [SONiC system architecture](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/Architecture) and adds a *new docker container* in the user space named **dash container** to create the functional component for DASH.  

In the **sync-d container** we will add **sai api DASH** (as opposed to *sai api* in the original SONiC architecture).  

The *DPU/IPU/SmartNic* hardware will run a separate instance of SONiC-DASH on the hardware.  

The component interactions will be executed as a new user space container implementation; relying on the existing SONiC infrastructure and components to interact as they normally would.  

The functionality of the new *dash container* in the user space is to receive content from the Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller to control setup for the overlay configurations. DASH receives the objects, translates them with a **gNMI agent**, provides them to the *SONiC OrchAgent* for further translation onto the dataplane via the **SAI database**. 

> [!NOTE]
> Need a drawing and descriptions of the DASH user space **state interactions** (similar to the one shown in the figure at this location [LLDP-state interactions](https://github.com/Azure/SONiC/wiki/Architecture#lldp-state-interactions).  

@lihuay @lguohan @prsunny - would you review and/or improve this write-up?
