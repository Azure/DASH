## Overview 

This document describes the **SONiC Disaggregated API for SONiC Hosts** (SONiC DASH) high level design and architecture. SONiC DASH (DASH for short) is an open source project that will deliver enterprise network performance to critical cloud applications. DASH is intended to become a major **Open NOS for Programmable Hardware Technologies**, including [SmartNICs](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/10/29/what-is-a-smartnic/), to supercharge a variety of cloud and enterprise applications

DASH extends SONiC APIs and a comprehensive set of object models that initially describe Microsoft Azureâ€™s networking services for the cloud. The 7 initial services (in draft) located in the GitHub repo https://github.com/Azure/DASH describe this in more detail. The project enlists cloud and enterprise providers to further extend DASH to meet their specific needs.


## Requirements

The ovreall requirement is to optimize network SMART Programmable Technologies performance and leverage commodity hardware technology to achieve 10x or even 100x stateful connection performance.
- With the help of network hardware vendors, create an open forum that capitalizes on the use of **programmable networking hardware** including SmartNICs, SmartToRs, SmartAppliances. 
- Optimize **stateful L4** performance and connection scale by 10x or even 100x when compared to implementations that make extensive use of software. As host networking in the cloud is performed at L4 the resulting performance improvements should be truly significant.
