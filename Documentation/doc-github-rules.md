This document describes a short process to effectively use Github to achieve the following main goals:

1. Proposing a change. 
2. Reporting a bug. 
3. Making impovement suggestions.   


## Create issues

You use the **Issues** mechanism to report problems, bugs and suggest general improvements. This is for both internal and external contributors. 

This approach is useful if you want to 

- Flag items that cannot be addressed by a single PR.
- Request that may need to be analyzed to find the proper course of action.
- Record information to put on backlog.  

Please, include relevant details the rest of the team needs to understand in order to discuss the issue effectively. 

For more information, see [Creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). 


## Create a fork

You fork a repository to propose changes to the main repository.
This is for external contributors that do not have the ability to create PRs directly against the main repository. It can also be used by internal contributors for tasks that cannot be addressed by issuing PRs against the main repository.

This approach is useful if you want to 

- Fix a pubished artifact.
- Create a new artifact.
- Improve overall readibility, usefulness, and quality.
   
In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the original repository. 

### Create a pull request (PR) in a forked repository




For more information, see 

- [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)


## Create pull request (PR) in the main repository 

You use a pull request (PR) to propose changes to a repository. The changes can be accepted or rejected by the repository's contributors. This is for internal contributors. For more information, see [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
