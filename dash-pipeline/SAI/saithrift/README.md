# Tips and techniques for writing tests
## Workspace File Layout
Below is depicted a selected subset of the DASH repo pertinent to understanding source and build artifact locations needed for saithrift test development.

Note that the `SAI/SAI` directory is a Git submodule and its contents are modified during `make sai` and `make saithrift-server`.
```
DASH
  dash-pipeline
    SAI                   - top-level dir for SAI-related artifacts
      saithrift           - saithrift client/server infra and test cases
        pytest            - DASH tests using Pytests with saithrift
        ptf               - DASH tests using PTF with saithrift
    rpc                   - output dir for saithrift code generator
                            contains client & server libraries & executable, see below
      SAI                 - Git submodule root, imported into DASH repo
        extensions        - DASH extension headers - mix of repo files + generated via "make sai"
        inc               - upstream sai headers
        meta              - generated SAI metadata, scripts, etc.
        test
          saithriftv2     - autogenerated saithrift tools, outputs
```
## saithrift Python client modules
Here are the detailed contents of `DASH/dash-pipeline/SAI/rpc/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sai_thrift`. You need to utilize the APIs and constants to write saithrify tests in PTF or Pytest.
>**Note:** These artifacts are generated via the `make sai-thrift-server` target, they are not stored in the repo.
```
constants.py     - wrapper for ttypes.py, not interesting
sai_adapter.py   - Main source of APIs for saithrift, e.g. create/remove/get/set
sai_headers.ph   - constants e.g. SAI_STATUS_SUCCESS
sai_rpc.py       - lower-level thrift marshalling/unmarshalling etc. Called by sai_adapter.py functions
ttypes.py        - SAI data types
```
         
# Debugging Server with GDB
`gdb` is built into the saithrift server image for easy debugging. Server code is compiled with the `-g` flag to include debug symbols. The saithrift server source code is available from withint the running DOcker container via volume mounts. Below is shown some a typical workflow:

## Run Interactive saithrift-server container
This starts the container and opens a bash session instead of running the server like normal. The working directory `/SAI/rpc/usr/sbin` contains the saiserver.
```
$ make run-saithrift-server-bash 
docker run --rm -it --net=host --name dash-saithrift-server-chris -v /home/chris/chris-DASH/DASH/dash-pipeline/bmv2/dash_pipeline.bmv2/dash_pipeline.json:/etc/dash/dash_pipeline.json -v /home/chris/chris-DASH/DASH/dash-pipeline/bmv2/dash_pipeline.bmv2/dash_pipeline_p4rt.txt:/etc/dash/dash_pipeline_p4rt.txt -v /home/chris/chris-DASH/DASH/dash-pipeline/SAI:/SAI -w /SAI/rpc/usr/sbin -v /home/chris/chris-DASH/DASH/dash-pipeline/SAI/SAI/meta:/meta -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/SAI/lib:/usr/local/lib chrissommers/dash-saithrift-bldr:220719 \
/bin/bash
chris@chris-z4:/SAI/rpc/usr/sbin$
```
Start gdb on the saiserver process:
```
chris@chris-z4:/SAI/rpc/usr/sbin$ gdb saiserver

Point gdb to the mounted source directory which which must be build locally via `make saithrift-server`:
```
(gdb) dir /meta
Source directories searched: /meta:$cdir:$cwd
```
Set some breakpoints.
```
(gdb) b sai_api_query
Breakpoint 1 at 0x76d90
(gdb) b create_outbound_eni_to_vni_entry
Function "create_outbound_eni_to_vni_entry" not defined.
Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y
Breakpoint 2 (create_outbound_eni_to_vni_entry) pending.
```
Run the process:
```
(gdb) r
