DASH in 'VM' Mode

DASh in 'Floating NIC' Mode




Current Scenario:

Packet Flow Using NVA VM (Current Scenario)  

The diagram below demonstrates the current legacy scenario. 
Here the packet flows from the source and needs to transit a VM for processing before making its way to the destination.  


Packet Flow USING FLOATING NIC (New Scenario)

The diagram below builds upon the legacy scenario. Here the NVA VM is completely removed and just a NIC exists. This NIC is termed “floating” since it is not attached to any VM.
