## Overview

This scenario is the starting point to design, implement and test the core DASH
mechanisms. In particular it allows the following:

- VM to VM communication in VNET, using an Appliance for rules and routing offload
- Route support
- LPM support
- ACL support

The intent is to verify the following performance properties: **CPS**, **flow**, **PPS**, and **rule scale**.

## Moving packets from source VM to destination VM

To understand DASH *performance enhancements and programmability*, it is
important to understand the path where packets are transferred from source to
destination; in this scenario - from source VM to destination VM in a VNET
environment.

To make an analogy, it is similar to establishing a dedicated circuit between
Point A and Point B for the duration of a call in a telephonic switch, between a
caller and a receiver. The first time the connection (circuit) is initiated and
established, it takes more time due to the full setup for exchange that is
required. We call this a **slow path**. After the connection is established, the
messages between caller and receiver can be exchanged via the established path
and flow (without overhead). We call this **fast path**.

With respect to packets and flows between VMs in VNET, a tunnel (equivalent to
the circuit of a telephonic switch) is established between the source VM to the
Appliance, and from the Appliance to the destination VM (after packet rules,
routing, and transforms). This tunnel (along with some SDN feature work) will
redirect the packets to a DPU, for example - in an appliance. This is where the
DASH performance enhancements (so called *bump in the wire*) happens.

## Packet transforms

Packet transformation plays a crucial role when moving a packet from a source to
a destination. Before we look at the example, let's define a few terms.

- **Flows**. It describes a specific *conversation* between two hosts (SRC/DST
  IP, SRC/DST Port). When flows are processed and policy is applied to them and
  then routed, the SmartNIC (or DPU) records the outcomes of all those decisions in a
  **transform** and places them in the **flow table** which resides locally on
  the card itself.  

  > [!NOTE] This is why sometimes the term *transform* and *flow* are used
  > interchangeably.

- **Transforms**. It is represented either by *iflow* (initiator) or *rflow*
  (responder) in the **flow table**. It contains everything the SmartNIC needs to
  route a packet to its destination without first having to apply a policy.
  Whenever the SmartNIC receives a packet, it checks the local *flow table* to see if
  the preparatory work has been done for this flow. The following can happen:

  - When a *transform* or *flow* doesnâ€™t exist in the *flow table*, a **slow
    path** is executed and policy applied.
  - When a *transform* or *flow* does exist in the *flow table*, a **fast path**
    is executed and the values in the transform are used to forward the packet
    to its destination without having to apply a policy first.

- **Mapping table**. It is tied to the V-Port, and contains the CA:PA (IPv4,
  IPv6) mapping, along with the FNI value of the CA for Inner Destination MAC
  re-write and VNID to use for VXLAN encapsulation.

  > [!NOTE] The Flexible Network Interface (FNI) is a 48-bit value which easily
  > maps to MAC values. The MAC address of a VNIC (VM NIC or BareMetal NIC) is
  > synonymous with FNI. It is one of the values used to identify a V-Port
  > container ID.  

- **Routing table**. A longest prefix match (LPM) table that once matched on
  destination specifies the action to perform VXLAN encapsulation based on
  variables already provided, VXLAN encap using a **mapping table** or *Overlay
  Tunnel* lookup for variables, or *L3/L4 NAT*. Routing tables are mapped to the
  V-Port.

- **Flow table**. A global table on a SmartNIC that contains the transforms for all
  of the per-FNI flows that have been processed through the data path pipeline.

## Processing pipeline

The processing pipeline must support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols for both underlay and overlay, unless explicitly stated that some scenario is IPv4-only or IPv6-only. 

### ENI selection 

Once packet arrives on **Inbound** to the target (DPU), it must be forwarded to the correct ENI policy processing pipeline. 
This ENI selection is done based on the **inner destination MAC** of the packet, which is matched against the MAC of the ENI. 

### Policy processing per ENI

The following figure shows the inbound pipeline that comprises the steps: Network --> Routing --> ACLs --> VM.

## Packet transform example

The following is an example of packet transformation in VM to VM communication in VNET.

### V-Port definition

- Physical address = `100.0.0.2`
- V-Port Mac = `V-PORT_MAC`

### VNET definition

- VNET1 `10.0.0.0/24`
- VNET2 `20.0.0.0/24`

### VNET mapping table

| | V4 underlay| V6 underlay| Mac-Address| Mapping Action | VNI
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:--------------|
| 10.0.0.1| 100.0.0.1| 3ffe :: 1| Mac1| VXLAN_ENCAP_WITH_DMAC_DE-WRITE| 100 |
| 10.0.0.2| 100.0.0.2| 3ffe :: 2| Mac2| VXLAN_ENCAP_WITH_DMAC_DE-WRITE| 200 |
| 10.0.0.3| 100.0.0.3| 3ffe :: 3| Mac3| VXLAN_ENCAP_WITH_DMAC_DE-WRITE| 300 |

### Understanding packet handling

When talking about packet handling, we need to think about a process that involves three main steps: transforming, mapppng and routing. Let's walk through these steps using  the table shown in the section below [Packet transform summary](#packet-transform-summary).

#### Match action tables

This step, as per the P4 model, see [P416 Language
Specification](https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.2.2.html), is executed based on a set of **match/action** tables which are traversed sequentially by the P4 parser.

> [!NOTE] A P4 program defines a packet-processing pipeline, but the rules
> within each table are inserted by the control plane. When a rule matches a
> packet, its action is invoked with parameters supplied by the control plane as
> part of the rule.

The following are the example applicable tables.

##### Table ACL1

The following table prescribes that the packets directed to the destination address `10.0.0.10` are blocked, while the packets directed to all other destinations are allowed (default). 

|Match/Action|Value              |
|------------|-------------------|
|default     |allow              |
|match       |dst add=`10.0.0.10`|
|action      |block              |

##### Table ACL2

The following table prescribes that the packets directed to the destination address `10.0.0.11` are blocked, while the packets directed to all other destinations are allowed (default). 

|Match/Action|Value              |
|------------|-------------------|
|default     |allow              |
|match       |dst add=`10.0.0.11`|
|action      |block              |

##### Table ACL3

The following table prescribes that the packets directed to all destinations are allowed (default). 

|Match/Action|Value              |
|------------|-------------------|
|default     |allow              |

#### Routing table

The routing step shown in the following table defines when a packet is routed from the source to the destination.

|Match/Action|Value                 |
|------------|----------------------|
|match       |dst add==`20.0.0.0/24`|
|            |src add=`10.0.0.0/24` |
|action      |allow                 |

#### Mapping

From the previopus [VNET mapping table](#vnet-mapping-table) table and considering the routing discussed before you get the following:

|Source               |Destination                   |Action                    |Routing/Mapping                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|`10.0.0.1`           |`10.0.0.10`                   |Blocked (ACL1)            |Blocked                            |
|`10.0.0.1` SMAC1     |`10.0.0.11` DMAC_FAKE         |Blocked (ACL1, ACL2)      |Blocked                            |
|`10.0.0.1` (1) SMAC1 |`10.0.0.2` (2) DMAC_FAKE      |Allowed (ACL1, ACL2. ACL3)|Matched LPM route `10.0.0.0/24` (3)|

**Notes**

- (1) Outer: Physical host IP, VXLAN VNI: custom, Inner Mac: SMAC1
- (2) Outer: Physical SDN Appliance IP, DMAC_FAKE
- (3) **Execute action VNET** that will look up in the mapping table and take mapping action.
This mapping action is (row 2 of the [VNET mapping table](#vnet-mapping-table)):
  - Outer:
    - SRC: `100.0.0.1`
    - DST: `100.0.0.2`
  - VXLAN
    - VNI: 200
  - Inner Mac:
    - SRC - SMAC1 DST
  - Mac1
    - Inner IP: `10.0.0.1` -> `10.0.0.2`.

- [DMAC_FAKE](https://github.com/Azure/DASH/wiki/Glossary#dmac_fake). A hardcoded MAC address (ex: 12:34:56:78:9a:bc). It is not a MAC of an actual VM, it is simply a MAC address to "satisfy" the TCP/IP stack of Windows/Linux.

### Packet transform summary

The following table summarizes the process of transforming, mapping and routing.  

| SRC -> DST <img width=1000/>| Out-ACL1| Out-ACL2| Out-ACL3| Routing <img width=1000/>| Final <img width=1000/>|
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------
