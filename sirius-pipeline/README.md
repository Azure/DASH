# Sirius Pipeline P4 Behavior Models
**TODO**

TCP AND UDP

Fragmentation

NACK write-up in documentation

Sequence # tracking for FIN and final ACK (already started) FIN/ACK ACK - Reshma/Anjali to write into PR

Tracking the ACKs, close down xns more quickly?

Do we need to track the sequence # to ensure it is tracking for the FIN?  - add to doc

Are we garbage-collecting re: how long to wait?  (look for stale or temporal xns) - add to doc

Absolute timer?  For most cases we will get the close. Timers are expensive; expands flow table, esp at high xn rates?

If flow cache is behaving correctly (aging out, etc...) s/not have active xns.  

3 variables:  rate, working set of flows, backup.

Background tasks removing temporal flows?  Advantage here vs. sequence # tracking?  

Expense of timer vs. sequence #.  Timer = less expensive.

Enforce xn rate limit?
